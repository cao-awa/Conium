> This is the planning conception, not the description to Conium now!

# Conium planning
Conium planning to provide a new way to develop mods and datapacks that easy, useful and high performance.

Conium is dynamic, without compilations, and hidden all details that you don't need to pay attention to.

# What is this
The Conium is a framework or library, the classical mod can use Conium APIs with method call in Java and Kotlin.

Simultaneously, Conium can load datapacks and scripts automatically, the script can export event contexts, then classical mod can interaction to those contexts.

## Framework
Conium wants to be a half-automatic framework, the Conium can load entrypoint that annotated ``@Auto``, and can serialize and deserialize NBTs in game elements, handle events and do dependency injects, invert of control to proxy the register and others details, all automatically and peaceful.

Let developers focus on the mod content instead of those complicated steps that can be hidden by Conium framework.
